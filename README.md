# 32 Bit MIPS Processor
 Designed a 32 Bit MIPS 5 stage pipelined processor in Verilog with my partner for our ECE 369 course. The processor in was designed to handle Arithmeticc, Data, Branching, Jumping, and Logical MIPS instructions utilizing concepts such as data forwarding, data hazards, and pipeling. The processor was created in Verilog and then implemented onto an FPGA board.
 
 The assembly code was programmed to take in a MxN frame that would then traverse a PxQ window in a Zig-Zag pattern and perform a sum of absolute differences calculations. This code was debugged using QTSpim and then loaded into the processor's instruction and data memory.
 
 The python script was written to automate the process of trascribing a binary text file into a hexadecimal text file equivalent.
